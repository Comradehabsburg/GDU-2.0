 nobodys_home_desc:0 "Her feeling she hides, her dreams she can't find, she's losin' her mind, she's fallen behind, she can't find her place, she's losin' her faith, she's fallen from grace, she's all over the place, yeah, she wants to go home, but nobody's home, that's where she lies, broken inside, with no place to go, no place to go, to dry her eyes, broken inside, she's lost inside, lost inside, oh, oh, she's lost inside, lost inside, oh, oh, oh."
